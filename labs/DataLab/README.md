# Data Lab

> Students implement simple logical, two's complement, and floating point functions, but using a highly restricted subset of C. For example, they might be asked to compute the absolute value of a number using only bit-level operations and straightline code. This lab helps students understand the bit-level representations of C data types and the bit-level behavior of the operations on data.

* `tmin`:
  * 补码最小值 -2^(32-1) = -2147483648
* `isTmax`:
  * 补码最大值 2^(32-1) - 1 = 2147483647
